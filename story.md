Once, in outer space, the sun gets hungry, it wants to eat the 8 planets- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
The planets have to save themselves.
You have to be eithr bigger or brighter then than the sun to save your planet from the disaster.
If you succeed, you will eat the sun and win the game.
But.... if you lose, then the sun will eat you and you will lose your planet.
